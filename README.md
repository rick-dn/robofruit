DOI: https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA46639.2022.9812303

In this paper we present two novel datasets of strawberries annotated with picking points, key-points (such as the shoulder points, the contact point between the calyx and flesh, and the point on the flesh farthest from the calyx), and the weight and size of the berries. We performed experiments with Detectron-2, which is an extended version of Mask-RCNN with key-points detection capability. The results show that the key-points detection approach works well for picking and grasping point localization. The second dataset also presents the dimensions and weight of strawberries. Our novel baseline model for weight estimation outperforms many state-of-the-art deep networks. The datasets and annotations are also available at
